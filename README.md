> A Vue.js project that represents a simulator UI

## Build Setup

You must first unzip the project then...

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

```

## Libraries

I used Vue.js to build this application. I wanted to try it out this frameworks since it
is what you are planning to use at Sigma. ESLint was also another library that made
debugging, writing, and learning the code easier as it picked up errors before
me needing to compile the code. There were some pre-included libraries when I
created the Vue project, like Babel, that I implicitly used.
